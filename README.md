===================================================

This is a port of Lazarsoftâ€™s qrcode reader

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/edi9999/jsqrcode.svg?branch=master&style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/edi9999/jsqrcode)

Installation
============

```
npm install qrcode-reader
```

Usage
=====

```
var QrCode = require('qrcode-reader');
```

Create a new instance of QrCode:

```
var qr = new QrCode();
```

Set its callback to a custom function:

```
qr.callback = function(error, result) {
  if(error) {
    console.log(error)
    return;
  }
  console.log(result)
}
```

Decode an image by its URL or Data URI:

```
qr.decode(url or DataURL);
```

Decode an image by context.getImageData: Works with [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).

```
var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
var data = context.getImageData(0, 0, width, height);

qr.decode(data);
```

Decode from canvas with "qr-canvas" ID:

```
qr.decode()
```

Building it yourself
====================

If you want, you can build the script yourself.

First clone the repository, then from the directory of this repository, do:

```
npm install
```

To run the build process and generate a JavaScript file called `dist/index.js` you can run from node:

```
npm run build
```

To run the tests:

```
npm test
```

Make it work in the browser
===========================

The generated file `dist/index.js` works in the browser.

You will have access to the global variable `QrCode` if you do the following in your HTML:

```
<script src="dist/index.js"></script>
```

See [examples/browser-upload/index.html](examples/browser-upload/index.html) for a very basic example using a file upload.
